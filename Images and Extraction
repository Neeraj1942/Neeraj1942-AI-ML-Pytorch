Images ->
They are stored in matrix of pixel values
0 represents black(lower intensity) , 255 represents white(higher intensity)
matrix of numbers is known as a channel
size of the image is length and breadth of the matrix 
pixel value tells us the intensity of the pixel

Every coloured image has 3 channels ( red green and blue) 
colour image -> N * M * 3 -> L * W * 3(represents number of channels)
greyscale images -> N * M *! (1 is the channel)
