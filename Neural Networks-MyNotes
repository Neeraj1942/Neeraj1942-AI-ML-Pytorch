3 types of layers ->
1. Layer 1  -> Input Layer  -> Takes input features
2. Layer 2  -> Hidden Layer -> Applies weights and biases, then passes through an activation function
3. Layer 3  -> Output Layer -> Transforms hidden layer output into a final prediction.

Then,
Fire or No Fire -> for inputs like x1 ,x2 ->
x1 + x2 > threshold -> Fire 
x1 + x2 < threshold -> No Fire
 
x1 + x2 - threshold > 0
x1 + x2 - threshold < 0

when (-threshold = bias)


Mainly there are 3 steps ->
1. Bias -> Bias is an extra parameter added to the weighted sum.
It helps the network make predictions even when all inputs are zero.

x1 + x2 + bias > 0  -> Fire
x1 + x2 + bias > 0  -> No Fire

2. Weights -> Weights are the learnable parameters that control the strength of the connection between neurons in one layer to the next.
Each input is multiplied by a weight before being passed forward.

y(output) = wo + x1
