Understanding the working of Neural Networks
Deep Learning ->

Machine Learning ->
1. Learning from the data
2. Making predictions

Good for use case->
1. Structured data and simpler tasks
2. Requires less data to learn
3. cpus smaller servor
4. less time to train

Deep Learning ->
1. Algorithm Approach
2. Data Requirement
3. Types of Problems

Good for use case->
1. Unstrcuted data and complex tasks
2. Requires more/large data to learn
3. gpus and cpus required, tpus
4. 

Computer Vision -> field of study which deals with extracting inofrmation from images and videos
NLP -> Field of study which extracts information from text

Applications of deep learning ->
Language interpretations - > Google assistance, chatgpt
Recommendation systems -> spotify, netflix
Image recognition and computer vision -> face id , tesla autopilot
